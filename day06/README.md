# Day 6 Challenge

I completed the first part - the code to do it is gone since I messed it all up
trying to solve the second part and I didn't push it to git before messing it uo.

The second part has stumped me. I can get the test case to work, but with the real
input data I get stuck in an endless loop. Maybe my approach is bad:
   *  Cycle through every cell, creating an obstruction in that cell
   *  Walk the grid and see if I get stuck in a loop

If I skip adding the obstruction I don't get stuck in a loop.....

Moving on to Day 7 Challenge.
